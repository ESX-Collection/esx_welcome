# esx_welcome

The esx_welcome script is a basic script to welcome people into the server.
it will do this by automatically writing what you want in the chat, when people spawn. 
I made this script to practice my LUA abilities. so dont espect it to be the best.

You can change your config in the client.lua file. Right now it will say "Insert text here".
